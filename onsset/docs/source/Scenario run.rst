Scenario run
=================================

If the previous steps have been successful, running an electrification scenario with **gep_onsset** is a fairly straightforward process. 

Running with GEP Generator
*******************************

The simplest way to run a scenario is via ``GEP Generator.ipynb``. You may refer to the previous section on how to get is up running. In order to run a scenario you will need:

- **The primary input file** (see *Malawi.csv* from previous section)
- **Fill in the calibration parameters** (same as *Steps 2,4 and 5* from previous section)
- **Provide the scenario parameters** (*Steps 3 & 6*)

.. note::
	**The GEP "levers"**

	The GEP levers refer to 7 key decision parameters, the selection of which can drastically change the output of the electrification analysis. They cover the following:

	- Population growth rate
	- Level of electricity consumption in to-be-electrified settlements
	- Targeted national electrification rate in the intermediate year 
	- Expected electricity generating cost for the central grid
	- Capital cost of photovoltaic systems
	- Diesel price
	- Electricity demand targets for productive uses (agriculture, health, education)
	- Rollout plan - prioritization (e.g who gets electricity first and how?)

	Each lever has 1-3 possible options the combination of which can generate 216 scenario as presented in the `GEP Explorer <https://electrifynow.energydata.info/>`_. The GEP generator guides the selection process with embedded documentation and link to the relevant sources. 

**Step 7** runs the electrification analysis for the specified scenario. **Note** that in this step, you may also provide the parameter `cost_choice` if you want to include (1) or exclude (2) break down of investment costs. The first option will add computational time in the analysis.

**Step 8** prepares a summary table, four graphs and a map over the key results of the analysis for a quick, on-the-fly review. 

**Step 9** exports the results into 3 csv files:

	- The **_Variables**.csv file provides a summary of input variables 
	- The **_Summaries**.csv file provides a summary of key results of the electrification analysis 
	- The **_Results**.csv file provides the electrification results in full granularity. An overview of the content is available in the next section


Running with gep_runner
*******************************
The **gep_runner** is usually used to run multiple scenarios at once. As shown in the previous section, interaction with the code takes place in the python console. Upon initiation, you may select option 3 for scenario run(s).

- 1: To split countries in case of multiple country runs (used rarely)
- 2: To prepare/calibrate the GIS input file
- **3: To run scenario(s)**

.. note::
	1. In the latest update, you will also be prompted to provide the parameter `cost_choice` if you want to include (1) or exclude (2) break down of investment costs. The first option will add computational time in the analysis.
	2. It is also highly recommended that you use the existing patterns ``# TODO``, ``# RUN_PARAM`` and ``# REVIEW`` to navigate through the **gep_onsset.py** and **gep_runner.py** code. You can find more info on how to activate those in PyCharm `here <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/using-todo.html>`_.

Execution requires two files:

- **The specs file** (see previous section)
- **The calibrated input file** (see from previous section)

Scenario definition is possible in the ``ScenarioInfo`` sheet of the specs file. There one can parameterize the "levers" accordingly and create a bundle of scenarios. Each row represents one potential scenario. The **gep_runner** will run as many scenarios as defined in this sheet. 

The following table gives on overview of the potential scenario combinations.

+--------------------------------------+---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Therefore, the scenario ``0_0_0_0_0_0`` will respectively represent:

- low population growth
- low electricity demand target (e.g. U4R1)
- low electrification target in the intermediate year (e.g. 35%)
- low generating cost for the grid (e.g. 0.03)
- PV capacity cost as defined by the user
- low diesel price
- not including productive uses of electricity
- least cost prioritization

**Note** that in the ``ScenarioParameters`` sheet one can customize how the aforementioned codes are translated to tangible input variables in the **gep_onsset** code.

The **gep_runner** yields two csv files for each scenario. 

- The **_Summaries**.csv file that provides a summary of key results of the electrification analysis
- The **_Results**.csv file that provides the electrification results in full granularity 

.. note::
	The scenario coding convention is applied in the naming process of the output result files as well. For example the same scenario for Malawi would yield the result file names ``mw-1-0_0_0_0_0_0.csv``. You may refer to `GEP Data Ingest documantation <https://global-electrification-platform.github.io/docs/preparing-the-data/scenario-results/>`_ for additional info.
