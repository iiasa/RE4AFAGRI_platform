Welcome to gep_onsset user's guide!
===============================================

The extant documentation serves as a guide to `gep_onsset <https://github.com/global-electrification-platform/gep-onsset>`_. The latter is a modified version of `OnSSET <http://www.onsset.org/>`_ that was developed to support the functionalities of the `Global electrification Platform <http://www.globalelectrificationplatform.com/>`_. 

The following pages, aim to cover aspects related to the repricability and/or reproducibility of the **gep_onsset** model. That is, the following sections provide a guide on how to set up, prepare, customize and run the model at different levels andt/or entry points, but they **do not** provide an exhaustive description of the model's core functionality (for this you may refer to `here <https://onsset.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_).

.. note::
   Although the documentation is updated frequently, discrepancies might occur due to the evolving nature of the GEP project. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with us in case you observe any inconsistencies or you have any suggestions.
