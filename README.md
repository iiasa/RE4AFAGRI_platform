## Introduction and contents

The RE4AFAGRI platform...

- WaterCROP: WaterCROP is an evapotranspiration model to estimate the crop water demand by source (rainfall plus irrigation) as a function of the soil moisture available in the soil and the potential for irrigation expansion (by source, surface water or groundwater bodies) based on current yield gap.

- M-LED: M-LED is a Multi-sectoral Latent Electricity Demand geospatial data processing platform to estimate electricity demand in communities that live in energy poverty. The platform leverages big data and bottom-up energy modelling to represent the potential electricity demand with high spatio-temporal and sectoral granularity, with specific attention to the implications for water-energy-agriculture-development interlinkages.  

- OnSSET: OnSSET (the Open Source Spatial Electrification Tool) is a GIS based optimization tool that has been developed to support electrification planning and decision making for the achievement of energy access goals in currently unserved locations. 

- NEST: NEST (The NExus Solutions Tool) is a modeling platform that integrates multi-scale energy–water–land resource optimization with distributed hydrological modeling, providing  insights into the vulnerability of water, energy and land resources to future socioeconomic and climatic change and how multi-sectoral policies, technological solutions and investments can improve the resilience and sustainability of transformation pathways while avoiding counterproductive interactions among sectors. 

A more comprehensive background on the design and principles behind the RE4AFAGRI platform is found in Falchetta, G., Adeleke, A., Awais, M., Byers, E., Copinschi, P., Duby, S., ... & Hafner, M.
